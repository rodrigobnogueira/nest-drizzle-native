# Release Guide

Use this checklist when publishing `nest-drizzle-native`. A release is worth
doing when the package metadata, README, public API, docs shipped in the npm
tarball, or runtime behavior has changed in a way users benefit from.

Sample-only changes can usually wait for the next package release unless they
also fix package documentation, release metadata, or published files.

## Before Bumping

Confirm the package is ready:

```bash
npm run ci
npm run security:audit
```

Review the diff for:

- public API changes
- dependency and lockfile churn
- install or lifecycle scripts
- docs examples that expose secrets or unsafe connection strings
- sample changes that reveal a package bug

The published package must keep `"dependencies": {}` empty. Runtime
integrations belong in `peerDependencies`; package-local tooling belongs in
`devDependencies`.

## Version Sync

When bumping `packages/drizzle/package.json`, update every sample dependency on
`nest-drizzle-native` to the exact same version:

```bash
npm install
npm run release:check:sample-versions
```

`npm install` refreshes the workspace lockfile so samples resolve the same
version that will be packed.

## Release Checks

Run the release gate before publishing:

```bash
npm run release:check
npm ls nest-drizzle-native --workspaces --depth=0
npm run ci
```

`release:check` validates README/docs links, sample version sync, workspace
resolution, the package tarball, and a temporary consumer app that installs the
packed tarball.

## Publish

Publish from a clean, reviewed, merged `main` branch:

```bash
git status --short --branch
npm publish --workspace nest-drizzle-native --access public
```

Do not publish from a feature branch or with uncommitted files.

## Tag

After the registry version is confirmed, tag the exact release commit:

```bash
git tag nest-drizzle-native@<version>
git push origin nest-drizzle-native@<version>
```

## Post-Publish Verification

Verify the registry artifact and consumer path:

```bash
npm view nest-drizzle-native@<version> version
npm pack nest-drizzle-native@<version>
```

Then test a clean consumer or sample flow against the published version before
closing the release.
