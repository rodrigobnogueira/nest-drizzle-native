# Quality And CI

The project reports package quality in three places:

- GitHub step summaries for quick CI scanning.
- Sticky pull request comments for coverage, test performance, and cognitive complexity.
- Uploaded artifacts for raw coverage, test, and complexity data.

## Coverage

Coverage uses `c8` over the package source:

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

The gate currently requires 100% statements, branches, functions, and lines.
The PR coverage comment compares the pull request against cached base-branch
coverage when base data is available.

CI runs package coverage on Node.js 20 and Node.js 22. The Node.js 22 quality
job owns PR coverage, performance, and cognitive complexity comments so those
reports stay single-source and easy to read.

## Performance

Tests use `node:test`. `npm run test:cov` runs a small reporting wrapper that
writes `test-results.json` with suite and individual test durations parsed from
the test runner output.

The PR performance comment shows:

- passed, failed, and skipped counts
- suite count
- total test step duration
- test execution duration
- slowest suites
- slowest individual tests

When base data exists, each duration includes a diff against the base branch.

## Cognitive Complexity

Cognitive complexity uses SonarJS through ESLint:

```bash
npm run complexity:check
npm run complexity:report
```

`complexity:check` enforces the default threshold of `15` per source function.
`complexity:report` writes `complexity/cognitive-complexity-summary.json` with
totals, per-file aggregates, and the most complex functions.

The PR comment treats complexity as a review signal. The hard gate remains the
ESLint threshold.

## Driver Integration

Package tests exercise real Drizzle clients for libSQL, better-sqlite3,
PostgreSQL, and MySQL. GitHub Actions provides PostgreSQL and MySQL service
containers for the coverage job. Local runs skip those networked drivers unless
`NEST_DRIZZLE_NATIVE_POSTGRES_URL` and `NEST_DRIZZLE_NATIVE_MYSQL_URL` are set.

| Driver | Package test | Focused sample | Local behavior | CI behavior | Required env/service |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| libSQL | `driver-integration.spec.ts` | Most local samples use `@libsql/client` | Always runs with local file databases | Always runs with local file databases | None |
| better-sqlite3 | `driver-integration.spec.ts` | [`14-better-sqlite3-driver`](https://github.com/nest-native/nest-drizzle-native/tree/main/sample/14-better-sqlite3-driver) | Always runs with a local SQLite file | Always runs with a local SQLite file | None |
| PostgreSQL / `pg` | `driver-integration.spec.ts` | [`15-postgres-driver`](https://github.com/nest-native/nest-drizzle-native/tree/main/sample/15-postgres-driver) | Skips unless `NEST_DRIZZLE_NATIVE_POSTGRES_URL` is set | Runs against a PostgreSQL 16 service container | `NEST_DRIZZLE_NATIVE_POSTGRES_URL` or CI `postgres` service |
| MySQL / `mysql2` | `driver-integration.spec.ts` | [`16-mysql-driver`](https://github.com/nest-native/nest-drizzle-native/tree/main/sample/16-mysql-driver) | Skips unless `NEST_DRIZZLE_NATIVE_MYSQL_URL` is set | Runs against a MySQL 8.4 service container | `NEST_DRIZZLE_NATIVE_MYSQL_URL` or CI `mysql` service |

The package coverage jobs and the `Sample validation` job both receive
workflow-generated PostgreSQL and MySQL URLs. Those URLs are test-only and must
not be copied into docs, samples, or logs beyond generic matrix summaries.

## Release And Security

Release validation checks README/docs links, the package tarball, and a
temporary consumer app that installs the packed tarball:

```bash
npm run release:check
```

For the publish checklist, version sync rules, and post-publish verification,
see [Release Guide](release.md).

After publishing, verify the registry package with:

```bash
npm run release:check:published -- <version>
```

That command installs the published package in a clean consumer and in a
temporary sample workspace so the checks cannot accidentally pass through a
local workspace link.

Supply-chain auditing checks high-severity production risk:

```bash
npm run security:audit
```

Run the complete local gate with:

```bash
npm run ci
```
