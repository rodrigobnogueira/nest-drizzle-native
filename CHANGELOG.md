# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to `nest-drizzle-native` are tracked here.

This project follows semantic versioning for the published package. Sample,
documentation, and CI-only changes may remain in `Unreleased` until the next
package release is useful for users.

## Unreleased

No user-facing changes yet.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Updated package metadata and documentation links for the
  `nest-native/nest-drizzle-native` repository move.
- Improved discoverability for the optional Zod + Swagger/OpenAPI bridge sample
  without adding a package-level Zod API.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Focused samples for the Drizzle-Zod/OpenAPI bridge, better-sqlite3,
  PostgreSQL, and MySQL driver setup.
- A release guide covering version sync, release checks, publishing, tagging,
  and post-publish verification.
- Focused sample discovery through `npm run sample:focused`.

### Changed

- Clarified that DTO classes with `ValidationPipe` are the default Nest-native
  HTTP validation path, while Zod and `drizzle-zod` remain optional and
  app-owned.
- CI now runs package coverage on both Node.js 20 and Node.js 22.
- Documented that driver-specific samples should own driver pools/clients in
  application code and pass ready Drizzle clients into `DrizzleModule`.

### Security

- Updated the docs website lockfile to pick up the audited
  `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-systemjs` patch release.

  validation, sample validation, and supply-chain audit.
