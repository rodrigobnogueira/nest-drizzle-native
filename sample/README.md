# Samples

The sample tree follows the same shape as the main quality strategy:

- `00-showcase`: the planned full integration baseline.
- `01-*` onward: focused samples that isolate one topic each.

## Commands

```bash
npm run ci:sample
npm run sample:focused
npm run test --workspace nest-drizzle-native-sample-01-basic-client
```

## Sample Rules

Sample PRs must not include package source changes under `packages/drizzle/**`.
If a sample exposes a package bug, pause the sample branch and fix the package in
a separate PR first.

After each sample implementation, do a short follow-up review before opening or
updating the PR:

- **Library ergonomics**: Did the sample reveal an awkward API, missing helper,
  confusing type, or repetitive setup that belongs in `packages/drizzle`?
- **Architecture**: Did the sample need a pattern that should become the
  recommended Nest-native structure for modules, repositories, transactions, or
  testing?
- **Documentation**: Did the sample teach something that should be promoted to
  the README, Docusaurus docs, or API reference?
- **Performance**: Did the sample reveal unnecessary connection work, slow test
  setup, excessive boot cost, or query patterns that need guidance?
- **Maintainability**: Did the sample duplicate code that should become a shared
  sample helper, documented convention, or future library improvement?

Keep those follow-ups out of the sample PR unless they are documentation-only
changes that directly explain the sample. For library code, architectural
refactors, performance work, or package behavior changes, open a separate issue
or PR and reference it from the sample PR.
